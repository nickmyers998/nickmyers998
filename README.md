Hello!

My name is Nicholas Myers and I'm an Electrical Engineering major from the University of North Florida with minors in Computing and Mathematics.

This is my GitHub page where many of my personal and school projects are available for public view. Each project is located
in a separate repository alongside contextual documents.

My primary programming languages include:

  C, Embedded C, Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, and VBA
  
I have worked with these languages in a variety of contexts, including microcontroller programming, serial communication, 
control system simulation, image processing, MySQL database applications, data analysis, scripting, web scraping, and optimization.

This page includes projects which focused on specific applications of engineering and computer science software, of which I have gained hands-on experience and are listed here:

  NI MultiSim, MATLAB, Simulink, EAGLE, MPLABX, SolidWorks, MS Excel, Code Composer Studio, and MS Visual Studio
  
Many of these projects incorporated the use of hardware or physical circuit design. I have hands on experience with PIC and MSP microcontrollers (control systems and embedded systems), analog signal amplifier circuits (transconductance, voltage, and current amplifiers), digital logic circuits (multiplexers and state space circuits), serial communication circuits (I2C, UART, and RS-232), proportional actuation devices (solenoid valves), and instrumentation devices (mV/V and 4-20mA).

I am actively looking for internships and full time positions! The fields which I am most interested in are embedded software and firmware engineering, digital and analog circuit design, electronics engineering, data science, software engineering, and control systems.

If you would like to get in touch with me, I am readily available through email [nickmyers998@gmail.com].
