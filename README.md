Hello!

My name is Nicholas Myers and I'm an electrical engineering senior at the University of North Florida with minors in Computing and Mathematics.

This is my GitHub page where all of my personal and school projects are available for public view. Each project is located
in a separate folder alongside contextual documents.

My primary programming languages include:

  <b> C </b>
  Embedded C
  C++
  Python
  VHDL
  Java
  SQL
  MATLAB
  and VBA
  
I have worked with these languages in a variety of contexts, including microcontroller programming, serial communication, 
control system simulation, MySQL database applications, data analysis, scripting, web scraping, and optimization.

I am always interested in speaking with employment recruiters! The fields which I am most interested in are firmware engineering,
embedded systems engineering, digital and analog circuit design, software engineering, and controls engineering.

If you would like to get in touch with me, I am readily available through email [nickmyers998@gmail.com].
I can also be reached through my LinkedIn profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-myers-481a92145/

I consider all projects on this page to be open source, and there is no need to request permission before using code snippets pulled from any projects on this page. 

Thanks for visiting!

Nick
